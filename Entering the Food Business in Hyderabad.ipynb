THe extracted data can then be converted into a dataframe using pandas.\n\nThe geospatial coordinates of all the areas/neaighbourhoods can be extracted using the geopy and geo-coder packages. Passing the values extracted in scrapping through the geocoder user agent and fetching the geospatial coordinates. Then the entire data set extracted can be convereted into a dataframe using pandas.\n\nFoursquare API can be used to fetch the venues data in the city and the using clustering on this data the business question can be answered."
